## What is BeEF?

BeEF, The Browser Exploitation Framework, is an open-source penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser. It allows security professionals to assess the security posture of a target by exploiting vulnerabilities in the browser itself or its plugins. Unlike traditional exploitation frameworks, BeEF leverages client-side attack vectors by hooking browsers and using them as beachheads for launching further attacks.

## Common Uses: 
- Hook browsers for command and control
- Test browser-based vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Post-exploitation activities such as keylogging, network reconnaissance, and privilege escalation
- Simulate phishing and social engineering attacks via malicious web pages
- Red team operations for realistic browser attack scenarios

## Where itâ€™s useful:
- Web application security assessments
- Client-side penetration testing
- Red team and adversary emulation engagements
- Security training and awareness exercises
